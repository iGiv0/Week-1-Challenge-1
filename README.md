# Week-1-Challenge-1
Challenge 1 of the week one: Horiseon Website

Fixed the title so it is easy to read for the user.

Changed some of the <Div> elements to semantic elemenets.

Added a class of "services" & "benefits" so it would consolidate information on the CSS file, which makes it easier for the user to read.

Added some "#",aka (ids), in the CSS file so it would be a cleaner and shorter file.
